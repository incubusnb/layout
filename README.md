# Layout

This is just the initial layout for my website. I'm still messing with colors and toying with some ideas before I start adding content.  
You can view the site [here](https://incubusnb.github.io/layout/).

## TODO

- [ ] Improve color scheme and layout
- [ ] Use react to make the site interactive
- [ ] Populate sidebars with relevant content for each section
- [ ] Improve the footer
- [ ] Add more content
